# ProteinFolding
Protein Folding Exercises! 

We will use EMSFold as the AI tool to predict the 3D structure of the mouse protein alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). This protein has a length of 376 amino acids and is considered a medium sized protein. ESMFold performs best for proteins containing between 200-400 amino acids and out performs AlphaFold in this size range [1]. You may choose to use other proteins. The recommendation is to use proteins with size ranging between 200 to 400 amino acids. 
 
The code provided here will cover:

1. How to introduce mutations by randomly changing the amino acid sequence of a protein
2. How to predict the 3D structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence
3. How to calculate a score of how two protein structures resemble each other

All the provided code is contained in a Jupyter notebook along with the accompanying explanation
